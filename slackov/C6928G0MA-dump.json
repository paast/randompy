If \"1\" is one complete spin. The no matter how many \"spins\" you'd still be facing North. I'd understand better if \"1\" = a 90 degree \"turn\".", "Being set to 360 was actually correct,  since the instructions define \"1\" as a full spin, not just a 90\u00b0 turn. Although the modulo operator should be the right change", "Just remember we're all here for the same reason. And while we will develop these skills individually, everyone has different strengths and weaknesses and in the outside world will work as part of a team. It's a professional community. We're all nervous. You'll do great I'm sure.", "<@U6AMF49RC> Be sure to account for each turn being equal to 90 degrees. That is what helped me. I believe the issue with the problem was that it did not do that (it set it to 360), so the the error was semantic. After you do that, you can use the modulo operator to limit your results to under 360.", "Gotcha", "I'm not sure if it will be published by the time you meet, but it will be published by 6 or 6:30 at the latest. I'll make an announcement here when it is published. It is not due until next Sunday.", "No it will not be due tonight. I believe the due date is next Sunday.

Is it the last exercise under the Exercises section in Ch. 3?", "Ah, was looking at Chapter 5 instead of 3. They should be the same for everyone.\n\nIs the issue you are having that the result is not staying within the 0-360 scale?", "If it makes you feel better, only way to get anything less than an A is to not finish! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:", "Thanks for trying to help!  It's actually this problem.  (Do we all get different exercises?)\n\nPicture a compass where 0 degrees represents North, 90 degrees represents East, and so on, all the way around to 360 degrees, which is again the same as 0 degrees: true north.\n\nThe program below envisions the scenario in which a person is facing North (aka 0 degrees) and spins some number of rotations, either clockwise or counter-clockwise (-1 represents a full counter-clockwise spin and 1 represents a full clockwise spin). It calculates the direction they end up facing in degrees. However, it doesn\u2019t work properly. Find and fix the error in the program.", "Is it this problem \"Write a program to draw this.

I really want to be good at this. I have been practicing for a few months but there are times when I doubt myself and feel like I'm back at square one again.", "I already did the assignment too.

If you do work ahead, it's important to review it again before class so it's fresh on your mind.", "Me too...", "Hopefully won't be an issue cause I did as well.", "I really had to pace myself when I went through the course. As tempting as it was to work ahead, I found that if I stayed on target and didn't rush, I digested the material easier and didn't overwhelm my brain. Everybody is different, so definitely do the course however is best for you. But, just consider trying to not work weeks ahead - I found it really does help!", "Looking forward to tonight.
